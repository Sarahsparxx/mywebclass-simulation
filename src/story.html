        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to provide a dynamic and inclusive online learning environment that empowers students to
            explore, discover, and grow. Through cutting-edge technology and engaging educational resources, we strive
            to foster a lifelong love of learning, promote critical thinking skills, and inspire students to reach their
            full potential. Our goal is to create a community of learners who collaborate, support, and challenge one
            another, as they embark on a journey of discovery and personal growth.</p>

        <h2>Values</h2>
        <p><b>Inclusivity:</b> We value diversity and strive to create a website that welcomes all students,
            regardless of their background, culture, or abilities.</p>

        <p><b>Collaboration:</b> We believe that learning is a collaborative effort, and we encourage students to work
            together, share ideas, and support each other in achieving their academic goals.</p>

        <p><b>Creativity:</b> We recognize the importance of creativity in learning and provide opportunities for
            students to express themselves, think outside the box, and explore new ideas.
        </p>
        <p><b>Innovation:</b> We embrace technology and innovative tools to enhance the learning experience, foster
            engagement, and prepare students for a rapidly changing world.</p>

        <p><b>Responsibility:</b> We encourage students to take responsibility for their learning, set goals, and take
            ownership of their academic progress.</p>

        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>A group of passionate students Sarah Ibewuike, Awura Abena Adjei and Lorenzo Troia at
            New Jersey Institute of Technology came together with a shared vision: to create a digital platform that
            would transform the way students learn and teachers teach. They envisioned a website that would be more than
            just a repository of information, but a dynamic and interactive space that would engage students, foster
            collaboration, and inspire creativity. Over months of brainstorming, designing, and coding, they brought
            their vision to life, creating a website that combined cutting-edge technology with innovative teaching
            methods. They launched the website to great fanfare, and it quickly gained a reputation as a game-changer in
            the field of online education.</p>
